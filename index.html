          <p>In this site you will get the chance to <em> explore and view the begginnings </em> of a <strong><em> Web developer</em></strong> in the making!<br>
             Here you will see basic code as I am still learning all that I can. My goal is to grow my knowledge while improving this page.<br>
             I advise for you to make the effort to check in every week as I will have continue making improvements to this site!<br>
             There will be three different pages that I will develope over the course of several weeks, my index page, about page, and javascripts page.<br>
             You are currently on my Index page which will serve as my home page. I hope you enjoy and any and all critiques are welcome! <br>
             That's the only way for me to get better!  </p>
